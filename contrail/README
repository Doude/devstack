This fork of devstack brings up all in one openstack + opencontrail
system. Run stack.sh as usual to setup OpenStack + contrail modules.

Notes:
1) You will need to install kernel-devel package to compile OpenContrail
   Vrouter module
2) Stack.sh will create an additional screen "contrail" for contrail modules.
3) This fork includes Neutron and Nova patches. These patches have been
   seperately submitted for review.
4) OpenStack + OpenContrail has been tested on FC17, Ubuntu 12.04 and 13.10

Contrail directory also includes some sample localrc files.
1) localrc.master - Use this on all-in-one system or master host
on a multi node system. Set PHYSICAL_INTERFACE to the interface that
Vrouter should bind to. Uncomment MULTI_HOST line if setup has 
multiple compute nodes.

2) localrc.compute - Use this on all compute nodes. Change the 
following to suit your deployment:
 PHYSICAL_INTERFACE -- external interface Vrouter should bind to
 SERVICE_HOST -- IP address of master
