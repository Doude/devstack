This fork of devstack brings up all in one openstack + opencontrail
system. Run stack.sh as usual to setup OpenStack + contrail modules.

Notes:
1) You will need to install kernel-devel package to compile OpenContrail
   Vrouter module
2) Stack.sh will create an additional screen "contrail" for contrail modules.
3) This fork includes Neutron and Nova patches. These patches have been
   seperately submitted for review.
4) OpenStack + OpenContrail has been tested on FC17, Ubuntu 12.04 and 13.10
5) You need a github account. Register host's SSH keys to the github account
   otherwise checking out contrail code will fail. The repo tool assumes
   ssh and will not work with HTTPS git url. You can have ssh-agent forward
   keys to target system running devstack.

Contrail directory also includes some sample localrc files.
1) localrc-single: for all-in-one system 
2) localrc-multinode-server: master host on a multi node system. 
3) localrc-multinode-compute: all compute nodes. 

Change the following to suit your deployment:
 PHYSICAL_INTERFACE -- external interface Vrouter should bind to
 SERVICE_HOST -- IP address of master
