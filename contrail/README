Contrail directory includes some sample localrc files

1) localrc.master - Use this on all-in-one system or master host
on a multi node system. Set PHYSICAL_INTERFACE to the interface that
Vrouter should bind to. Uncomment MULTI_HOST line if setup has 
multiple compute nodes.

2) localrc.compute - Use this on all compute nodes. Change the 
following to suit your deployment:
